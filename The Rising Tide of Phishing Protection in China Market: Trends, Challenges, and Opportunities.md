<h3><strong>1. The Growing Threat of Phishing in China</strong></h3>
<p>Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting individuals and organizations through emails, text messages, and social media platforms. In China, the rapid adoption of digital technologies, coupled with the rise of remote work and cloud computing, has expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals.

For instance, phishing attacks in China&rsquo;s real estate sector surged by 1100% between 2015 and 2017, resulting in significant financial losses&nbsp;<span class="ds-markdown-cite">8</span>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the situation, with a sharp increase in phishing attempts exploiting pandemic-related themes. Cybercriminals impersonated health organizations and government agencies to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information. This surge in phishing attacks has driven businesses and individuals to invest heavily in phishing protection solutions&nbsp;<span class="ds-markdown-cite">8</span><span class="ds-markdown-cite">11</span>.</p>
